Here is a detailed comparison of the logic and algorithms between `chainlit_app/app.py` and `chainlit_app/app_original.py`.

### Overall Conclusion

The two files share the same core objective and high-level approach, but **the logic and implementation in `app.py` are significantly different and more advanced** than in `app_original.py`. `app.py` represents a major refactoring and enhancement of the original script, focusing on robustness, maintainability, and improved user experience.

### Key Similarities

*   **Core Task:** Both scripts implement a compliance-focused chatbot using the Chainlit framework.
*   **RAG Architecture:** Both use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. They retrieve relevant document chunks from a Qdrant vector database and use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate answers.
*   **Hybrid Search:** Both are configured to use a hybrid search approach (a combination of dense vector search and sparse keyword search).
*   **Clarification Flow:** Both scripts implement a crucial "clarification flow" to handle ambiguous user queries where multiple documents are retrieved with similar relevance scores. They ask the user to choose from a list of summarized topics.
*   **Chat Profiles:** Both use Chainlit's chat profiles to manage different LLM configurations (e.g., "Accounting Compliance" vs. "Deepthink").
*   **Admin Reply System:** Both feature a system to poll a Redis instance for replies from an "admin" and display them in the chat, enabling a human-in-the-loop escalation path.

### Major Differences and Evolution (`app.py` vs. `app_original.py`)

`app.py` is a clear evolution of `app_original.py`. The changes go beyond simple cleanup and represent a fundamental improvement in the application's structure and logic.

#### 1. Code Structure and Modularity

*   **`app_original.py`:** The logic is highly concentrated in a monolithic `on_message` function. This function is extremely long and contains deeply nested conditional blocks, making it very difficult to read, debug, and maintain.
*   **`app.py`:** The logic is broken down into smaller, single-responsibility functions. The `on_message` function is now a simple dispatcher that calls either `handle_clarification_response` or `handle_standard_query`. This is a significant improvement in code clarity and organization.

#### 2. State Management and Persistence

*   **`app_original.py`:** Relies heavily on the in-memory `cl.user_session` to manage the state of the clarification flow. While it has a basic `on_chat_resume` function, the restoration of the clarification state is incomplete.
*   **`app.py`:** Implements a far more robust state management system. It uses a dedicated **SQLAlchemy table (`clarification_state`)** to persist the entire context of the clarification flow (summaries, nodes, scores). The `on_chat_resume` function is now able to fully restore the user's session, including the pending clarification choice, making the user experience seamless across sessions.

#### 3. Configuration and Environment Management

*   **`app_original.py`:** Loads a single `.env` file from a hardcoded relative path.
*   **`app.py`:** Introduces an `ENV_MODE` environment variable. This allows it to dynamically load different configuration files (e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`), which is a best practice for managing different deployment environments.

#### 4. Clarification Flow Logic

*   **`app_original.py`:** The logic for handling the user's choice in the clarification flow is complex and mixed with tie-breaking and re-summarization logic inside the `on_message` function.
*   **`app.py`:** The clarification logic is cleaner and more robust.
    *   It explicitly handles a maximum number of clarification rounds to prevent infinite loops.
    *   The tie-breaking logic (`re_clarify`) is separated into its own function.
    *   The final answer generation from a chosen node (`answer_from_node`) is also a dedicated function.

#### 5. Response Determination and Generation

*   **`app_original.py`:** The determination of the response "level" (e.g., "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Rejected") is done with a series of `if/elif` statements inside `on_message`.
*   **`app.py`:** This logic is cleanly separated within the `handle_standard_query` function. The code is more readable, and the thresholds (`VECTOR_MIN_THRESHOLD`, `FUZZY_THRESHOLD`, etc.) are defined as clear constants.

#### 6. Utility Functions

*   **`app_original.py`:** Contains multiple, sometimes conflicting, utility functions (e.g., several definitions of `strip_html` and different table formatters).
*   **`app.py`:** Consolidates and refines these utilities. It has a single, improved `extract_and_format_table` function for presenting tabular data neatly. The `send_with_feedback` function standardizes how messages are streamed to the user.

### Summary Table

| Feature | `app_original.py` (The Old Way) | `app.py` (The New, Improved Way) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Structure** | Monolithic `on_message` function, hard to read. | Modular, with small, focused functions. |
| **State Management** | Fragile, session-based. Incomplete chat resume. | **Robust and persistent**, using a dedicated SQL table. |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded `.env` path. | Dynamic, based on `ENV_MODE` for dev/prod stages. |
| **Clarification Logic**| Entangled within `on_message`. | Cleanly separated into `handle_clarification_response`, `re_clarify`. |
| **Readability** | Low. Difficult to follow the flow. | High. Clear separation of concerns. |
| **Maintainability** | Low. Changes are risky and difficult. | High. Easier to debug, modify, and extend. |

In conclusion, while the core algorithm (RAG with clarification) is conceptually the same, the implementation in **`app.py` is vastly superior and logically distinct** due to significant refactoring, improved state persistence, and better software engineering practices.
